# Nutrients Calculator

I eat cereal for breakfast. I use this to figure out how much of which nuts to add.


## Usage

Edit the `Mix` that's instantiated at the end. run. repeat until the results are satisfactory.


## For Later

Pull nutritional data directly from usda food db, and calculate everything except energy in grams (no silly percent)

Custom conversion for each item from grams to percent, personalized to body mass n stuff.

Set nutritional thresholds and optimize for cost.
